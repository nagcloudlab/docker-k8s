i want to do training workshop on k8s,
with more microservices

1. product service
2. recommendation service
3. review service
4. product-composite service

external clients will call product-composite service
product-composite service will call other services
aggregate the result and return to client

all services in python, with flask

i want to showcase, on different iteration


1. simple co-ordinating services over API calls
2. containerizing the services
3. with database integration
    - product service with mongodb
    - recommendation service with mongodb
    - review service with postgres
3. with k8s integration 
    - service discovery
    - load balancing
    - scaling
    - rolling update
    - config map
    - secret
    - ingress
    - monitoring
    - logging
    - tracing

this is the plan for the workshop, help me with complete code
for each iteration
